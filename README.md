# cryptoc
Cryptography App developed in Python

WHY IS THIS A THING?
  - Ever since I started learning Python and using the Cryptohack website, I became fascinated with cryptography and what better way to put everything into practice than using the basic concepts that I learn to have a bit of fun. This included creating a ROT function entirely from scratch that works with any positive integer, encoding and decoding hex strings, using the XOR operator, the Pillow library to generate and decrypt images, etc. Now I'm lucky enough to have people to use it with and be ultra mysterious for no apparent reason.
